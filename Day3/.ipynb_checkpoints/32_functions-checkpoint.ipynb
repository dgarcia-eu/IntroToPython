    "    - Lists are mutable objects, meaning you can modify their contents without changing the object’s reference. In contrast, integers are immutable—you cannot change an integer’s value in place, so you must reassign it to make any modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable example:**\n",
    "    - In the example with the mutable list, num_sum[0] += 5 modifies the list in place. Python accesses the existing global num_sum list and updates the value at index 0, as the reference to the list remains unchanged. No new variable is created, and there’s no need to declare num_sum as global.\n",
    "    - While this code works, it is generally not considered best practice in Python. Modifying a global list by directly accessing its elements from within a function can lead to confusing and less maintainable code!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable example:**\n",
    "    - In the case of an immutable integer, num_sum += 5 implies reassignment. Python treats num_sum as a local variable due to the += operation, expecting it to be defined within the local scope. Since it’s not, you encounter an UnboundLocalError. To modify a global integer, you must explicitly declare it with the global keyword inside the function.\n",
